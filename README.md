## projects "Marketplace" (Karim)
/ about
We foster open source and innovation by highlighting existing open source solutions in the AECO space and functioning as a launch pad to build new solutions and communities.

Not the core team of os.construction will setup the content in the marketplace. Ideally, projects do this themselves. Projects either reach out or are approached by members of os.construction – either way, people fill out (and update) the project's card by themselve.

Early stage projects should also provide a simple "hello world" document (e.g. readme in their repo + reference template) to facilitate onboarding of new users. Can also be a description in notion / medium or anything else

## project "Data Management for AEC Professionals" (Max)
/ about
Data is becoming more and more important in our professional lives. At the same time, most practitioners in the AECO industry do not have a background in data or software engineering. To give people a help for a better understanding, we bring together the most relevant concepts of data management and enrich it with practical tips from industry experts.
The project can grow over time by continously adding examples and practical tips.
